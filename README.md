# Semantic Web Lab 2020-2021

This repository is to used to collect presentations and source codes for the semantic web lab.




## Description
In this lab, you will implement intelligent algorithms that work on knowledge graphs and also manipulate RDF data. 
Other topics may include implementing Explainable AI algorithms using Python and Scala.

* Short presentations (5 min) are required biweekly.
* No final project report is required but a detailed documentaion must be delivered at the end of the lab.
* The final deliverables (code and documentation) will be peer-evaluated.
* Final presentation (20 min).

## Time table
The participation in the first meeting is compulsury for all master students who wish to participate in the Lab Semantic Data Web Technologies.
